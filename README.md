# Hi, I'm Neal!
I'm a software engineer and self-described "product guy". For the past 6 years I was Head of Engineering at a startup. I am currently taking a break, exploring new opportunities, and working on some personal projects. I have been a software engineer for 18 years working in the video game, GIS, ad tech, and moving industries. I've shipped software for Xbox, PlayStation, Wii, Windows, Linux, IOS, Android, and the web. For the past 10 years I have managed product development teams and organizations.
